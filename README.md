# Albedo 0.93

> **Pre-release** — subject to refinements.

A carefully tuned light theme based on Atom One Light. **Albedo 0.93** explores the lower limit of background brightness while preserving clarity, contrast, and color accuracy. The name refers to the approximate reflectance of its background color (`#eeeeee`), chosen as a compromise between readability and visual comfort during long coding sessions. WCAG-compliant and thoughtfully restrained.
