# Albedo 0.93

> **Pre-release** — subject to refinements.

A carefully tuned light theme based on Atom One Light. **Albedo 0.93** explores the lower limit of background brightness while preserving clarity, contrast, and color accuracy. The name refers to the approximate reflectance of its background color (`#eeeeee`), chosen as a compromise between readability and visual comfort during long coding sessions. WCAG-compliant and thoughtfully restrained.

*Example using Fira Code*

> ℹ️ The name *Albedo 0.93* refers to the estimated reflectance of the theme’s background color (`#eeeeee`, or RGB 238, 238, 238), calculated using WCAG relative luminance.  
> While exploring names, the term *albedo* led to a recollection of *Albedo 0.39*, the 1976 album by Vangelis. Coincidentally, the reflectance value 0.93 turned out to be its inverse — a meaningful echo.  
> The theme icon, taken from that album cover, was chosen to reflect this symbolic symmetry rather than any direct conceptual link.
